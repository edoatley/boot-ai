**1. A one-line TLDR:**  
Kafka brokers require specific configuration parameters for proper operation in a clustered environment.

**2. A detailed summary in 2-3 paragraphs:**  
Kafka brokers, when deployed beyond a standalone setup, require careful configuration to ensure proper functionality within a cluster. One critical parameter is the `broker.id`, a unique integer identifier assigned to each broker within a Kafka cluster. While this integer is set to 0 by default, it must be unique and is recommended to be aligned with intrinsic host identifiers to simplify maintenance tasks. For instance, if hostnames contain unique numbers, these can be used for setting broker IDs.

Another vital configuration involves `listeners`, which define the network endpoints on which a broker listens for incoming connections. The configuration has evolved from simpler port settings to a more detailed URI format that includes protocol, hostname, and port. It's crucial to ensure that the correct security protocols are mapped if non-standard listener names are used. Care must be taken when choosing ports, especially those below 1024, as running Kafka as root is not advised.

Furthermore, the `zookeeper.connect` parameter specifies the location of the ZooKeeper ensemble used for storing broker metadata. This configuration is defined as a semicolon-separated list of hostname:port/path strings. Ensuring accurate configuration of these parameters is essential for the smooth operation of Kafka brokers in a clustered environment.

**3. Key points as bullet points:**

- Kafka brokers require unique `broker.id` values within a cluster.
- `broker.id` should ideally reflect intrinsic host identifiers for easier maintenance.
- `listeners` configuration has transitioned from simple port settings to URI-based formats.
- Non-standard listener names require `listener.security.protocol.map` configuration.
- Ports below 1024 require Kafka to be started as root, which is not recommended.
- `zookeeper.connect` defines the ZooKeeper ensemble location for broker metadata storage.
